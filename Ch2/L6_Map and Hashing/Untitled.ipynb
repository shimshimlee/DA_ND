    "\n",
    "As discussed earlier, when two different inputs produce the same output, then we have a collision. Our implementation of `get_hash_code()` function is satisfactory. However, because we are using compression function, we are prone to collisions. **Remember, that a key will always be unique. But the bucket_index generated by two different keys can be the same.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Consider the following scenario** - We have a bucket array of length 10 and we get two different hash codes for two different inputs, say 355, and 1095. Even though the hash codes are different in this case, the bucket index will be same because of the way we have implemented our compression function. Such scenarios where multiple entries want to go to the same bucket are very common. So, we introduce some logic to handle collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two popular ways in which we handle collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Separate chaining** - Separate chaining is a clever technique where we use the same bucket to store multiple objects. The bucket in this case will store a linked list of key-value pairs. Every bucket has it's own separate chain of linked list nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Open Addressing** - In open addressing, we do the following:\n",
    " * If, after getting the bucket index,  the bucket is empty, we store the object in that particular bucket\n",
    "\n",
    " * If the bucket is not empty, we find an alternate bucket index by using another function which modifies the current hash code to give a new code. This process of finding an alternate bucket index is called **probing**. A few probing techniques are - linear probing, qudratic probing, or double hashing. \n",
    "    \n",

    "Separate chaining is a simple and effective technique to handle collisions and that is what we discuss here. Let us visualize the new `bucket array` one more time as shown in the figure below:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Put Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the put operation, we first figure out the bucket index. Calculating the hash code to figure out the bucket index takes some time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* After that, we go to the bucket index and in the worst case we traverse the linked list to find out if the key is already present or not. This also takes some time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the time complexity for any algorithm as a function of the input size `n`, we first have to determine what our input is. In this case, we are putting and getting key-value pairs. So, these entries i.e. key-value pairs are our input. Therefore, our `n` is number of such key-value pair entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: time complexity is always determined in terms of input size and not the actual amount of work that is being done independent of input size. That \"independent amount of work\" will be constant for every input size so we disregard that.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* In case of our hash function, the computation time for hash code depends on the size of each string. Compared to number of entries (which we always consider to be very high e.g. in the order of $10^5$) the length of each string can be considered to be very small. Also, most of the strings will be around the same size when compared to this high number of entries. Hence, we can ignore the hash computation time in our analysis of time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now, the entire time complexity essentialy depends on the linked list traversal. In the worst case, all entries would go to the same bucket index and our linked list at that index would be huge. Therefore, the time complexity in that scenario would be $O(n)$. However, hash functions are wisely chosen so that this does not happen. \n",

    "`On average, the distribution of entries is such that if we have n entries and b buckets, then each bucket does not have more than n/b key-value pair entries.` \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, because of our choice of hash functions, we can assume that the time complexity is $O(\\dfrac{n}{b})$.\n",
    "This number which determines the `load` on our bucket array `n/b` is known as load factor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, we try to keep our load factor around or less than 0.7. This essentially means that if we have a bucket array of size 10, then the number of key-value pair entries will not be more than 7.\n",

    "**Answer:** The solution follows the same logic. We assume a constant time of operation for generating the hash code (bucket-index) for a given key. Ignore this constant time. Similarly, we can refer to the head of linked list at generated bucket-index in *O(1)* time. Next, we might have to traverse the the linked list in the worst-case scenario, making the time complexity as $O(\\dfrac{n}{b})$.
