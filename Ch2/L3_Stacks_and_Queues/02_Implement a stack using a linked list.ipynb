    "# Implement a stack using a linked list\n",
    "Previously, we looked at how to implement a stack using an array. While that approach does work, we saw that it raises some concerns with time complexity. For example, if we exceed the capacity of the array, we have to go through the laborious process of creating a new array and moving over all the elements from the old array.\n",

    "What if we instead implement the stack using a linked list? Can this improve our time complexity? Let's give it a try."

Then hide the solution, take a short break, and see if you can remember how to do it. Throughout this course, you will find yourself building on concepts you learned earlier. Whenever this is the case, it's good to take this same approach (try to remember, then check the solution, then hide the solution and try to remember again). This effort will help the ideas stick better."

    "## Time complexity of stacks using linked lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that if we pop or push an element with this stack, there's no traversal. We simply add or remove the item from the head of the linked list, and update the `head` reference. So with our linked list implementaion, `pop` and `push` have a time complexity of O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also notice that using a linked list avoids the issue we ran into when we implemented our stack using an array. In that case, adding an item to the stack was fine—until we ran out of space. Then we would have to create an entirely new (larger) array and copy over all of the references from the old array.\n",
    "\n",
    "That happened because, with an array, we had to specify some initial size (in other words, we had to set aside a contiguous block of memory in advance). But with a linked list, the nodes do not need to be contiguous. They can be scattered in different locations of memory, an that works just fine. This means that with a linked list, we can simply append as many nodes as we like. Using that as the underlying data structure for our stack means that we never run out of capacity, so pushing and popping items will always have a time complexity of O(1).\n",
